# OAuth

Pluto supports the auhorization based on [OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). For the implements, we also refers the code in the project [go-oauth2-server](https://github.com/RichardKnop/go-oauth2-server). We also add some customization of oauth2 to fit the pluto's design.
